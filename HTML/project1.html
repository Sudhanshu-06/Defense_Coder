    <h2>Who is a Frotend Developer?</h2>
    <p>
      A front-end developer builds the visual and interactive parts of websites
      and web applications that users see and interact with directly. They use
      core languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface
      (UI), ensuring it is responsive, accessible, and visually appealing. Their
      work includes managing everything from page layout and navigation to
      animations and handling user input.
    </p>
    <p>
      A front-end developer is a type of software developer who specializes in
      creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of
      websites and web applications. The primary responsibility of a front-end
      developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a
      website or application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and
      functionally efficient.
